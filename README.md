## Introduction
The Stock Market is a complex world in itself, and the stock price movement is hard to predict. Accurate predictions on how stocks are going to perform remain a crucial issue in finance. Participants in trading are constantly looking for techniques that can better predict stock price movements. Technical and Fundamental indicators based on the past performance of stocks can help us understand how the stocks are going to perform. However many factors can impact market sentiments like political news, social media buzz, and the latest developments in the company are a few of the examples which can change the stock trends. A massive amount of data gets generated daily hence predicting stock movement in a limited time is very challenging. We can use the Data Science processes to create machine learning models that can predict the stock price movement better than standard practices used in traditional strategies.
